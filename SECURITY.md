## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discovered a security issue with ExportTools, then please send me a DM on the Plex forums
https://forums.plex.tv/u/dane22/

That way, we can handle this privately, until a fix can be made

And if doing so, you will as the default be credited in the next versions changelog, unless you opt out of that

Thanks
